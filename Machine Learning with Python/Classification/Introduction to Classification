supervised learning approach which can be thought of as a means of categorizing or classifying some unknown items into a discrete set of classes

Classification attempts to learn the relationship between a set of feature variables and a target variable of interest

The target attribute in classification is a categorical variable with discrete values

Given a set of training data points along with the target labels, classification determines the class label for an unlabeled test case. 

Data classification has several applications in a wide variety of industries. 

Essentially, many problems can be expressed as associations between feature and target variables, especially when labelled data is available. 

This provides a broad range of applicability for classification
